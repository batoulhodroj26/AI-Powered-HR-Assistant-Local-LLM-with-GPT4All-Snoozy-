# AI-Powered-HR-Assistant-Local-LLM-with-GPT4All-Snoozy-
This project implements an AI-powered HR Assistant that can answer employee questions, retrieve details from a mock database, check leave balances, and generate interview questions. Unlike typical OpenAI API-based solutions, this project runs entirely locally using GPT4All Snoozy, so no API key or online calls are required.
